/*
    Color Codes, Escapes & Languages

    I was able to use colors in my terminal by using a variety of different escape values. 
    As the conversation implies above, different languages require different escapes, 
    furthermore; there are several different sequences that are implemented for ANSI escapes, 
    and they can vary quite a bit. Some escapes have a cleaner sequence than others. 
    Personally I like the \e way of writing an escape, as it is clean and simple. 
    However, I couldn't get it to work anywhere, save the BASH scripting language.

    Each escape works with its adjacent language
